## User Stories and Feature Tasks

*As a user, I want to be able to add new articles to my blog app so that it can stay current over time.*

- Review the image `preview.png` in the lab directory to get an idea of what we will be building.
- Focus on the functionality of adding a new article through a form submission by completing the TODOs in articleView.js.
- The new page with the form should provide a JSON string which can be copy/pasted into the data file to add articles to the blog.

*As a developer, I want to make the user experience easy to understand so that the user will want to return to the blog.*

- We now have two pages in our blog app, each of which need different initialization. There is a skeleton of a method in articleView.js to get this started for the new page; be sure to examine how this is now being done for the index page.
- The new page with the form will need event handling and a template. Where should these pieces go in the code?
- The new page should not display any other articles; how to manage this?

### Stretch Goal
*As a user, I want to add highlighting and Markdown formatting so that it is attractive to guests visiting my app.*

- We have two new libraries that we can add: HighlightJS (provides syntax highlighting of code blocks) and MarkedJS (allows use of Markdown format text). Link to (or include) these two libraries and implement them.
